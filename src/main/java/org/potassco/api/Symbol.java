public class Symbol {
/*
 class Symbol

    Represents a gringo symbol.

    This includes numbers, strings, functions (including constants with len(arguments) == 0 and tuples with len(name) == 0), #inf and #sup.

    Symbol objects implemente Python's rich comparison operators and are ordered like in gringo. They can also be used as keys in dictionaries. Their string representation corresponds to their gringo representation.
    Notes

    Note that this class does not have a constructor. Instead there are the functions Number(), String(), and Function() to construct symbol objects or the preconstructed symbols Infimum and Supremum.
