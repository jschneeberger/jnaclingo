/**
 * Forbid direct assembly wiring of a native method.<br>
 * On select platforms and when some conditions are met, BridJ connects the
 * native code to Java using optimized assembly glues, which might not be as
 * stable as using <a href="http://dyncall.org/">dyncall</a> (BridJ's ffi
 * library).<br>
 * In case of unexplained crash / bug, one should first try to set the
 * BRIDJ_DIRECT=0 environment variable or set the bridj.direct=false Java
 * property.<br>
 * If this solves the issue, <a
 * href="http://code.google.com/p/nativelibs4java/issues/entry">a bug should be
 * filed</a> and this annotation can be used as a workaround to selectively
 * disable raw calls for some methods.
